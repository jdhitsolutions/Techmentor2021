# Techmentor 2021

![Techmentor 2021](images/tm2021.png)

This repository contains the demonstration material from my sessions I delivered at Live 360/Techmentor, in Orlando, Florida in November 2021. Each session has a separate folder and set of files.

All material is offered __*as-is*__ and should be considered educational material. None of the code samples should be considered production-ready.
