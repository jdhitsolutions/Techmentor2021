# Live360/Techmentor 2021

![Techmentor 2021](images/tm2021.png)

This repository contains the demonstration material from presentations I delivered at Live 360/Techmentor, in Orlando, Florida in November 2021. Each session has a separate folder and set of files.

All files and code examples in this repository are offered __*as-is*__ and should be considered educational material. None of the code samples should be considered production-ready. You are welcome to use the code examples as starting points for your own work.
